      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>
        At MIDIverse Technologies, we are passionate about bridging the gap
        between music and technology. Founded by a team of musicians, engineers,
        and developers, our mission is to create powerful, intuitive MIDI

      </p>
      <p>
        We believe in open collaboration, modular design, and seamless
        integration with the tools you already use — and the ones you haven’t
        imagined yet.
      </p>

        🚀 To build a universe of intelligent MIDI tools that redefine how
