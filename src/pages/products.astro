      <h2>🧠 Why Our Gear Feels Different</h2>
      <p>
        We obsess over the details — from the tactile feel of the keys to the
        click of each encoder. All of our devices are assembled by hand, tested
        by musicians, and refined by feedback from our community. No fluff, no
        gimmicks — just pure, usable innovation made for real-world workflows.
      </p>
